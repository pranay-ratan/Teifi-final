    <h1>Magento to Shopify Plus Migration</h1>
</header>

    <main>
        <section class="intro">
            <p>This website presents a solution for migrating a large dataset from Magento to Shopify Plus, addressing key challenges in data extraction, transformation, loading, and synchronization.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="task1">
            <h2>1. Migration Plan</h2>
            <p>The migration plan outlines a structured approach using <b>dbt</b> for transformations, <b>Python</b> with <b>pandas</b> for data handling, <b>Shopify Bulk API</b> for loading, and <b>Prefect</b> for orchestration. The plan includes extraction, staging, transformation, validation, loading, and synchronization with ERP/CRM systems.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="task2">
            <h2>2. Data Cleanup Plan</h2>
            <p>The data cleanup plan utilizes <b>pandas</b> for efficient data manipulation and cleaning. <b>Regex</b> is employed for correcting SKU formats, and a <b>SQL</b> query is used to identify duplicate customer records. Here's an example of the SQL query:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    SELECT 'Email' AS DupField, email AS Identifier, COUNT(*) AS Count
                    FROM customers
                    WHERE email IS NOT NULL AND email <> ''
                    GROUP BY email
                    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
                    UNION ALL
                    SELECT 'Phone', phone, COUNT(*)
                    FROM customers
                    WHERE phone IS NOT NULL AND phone <> ''
                    GROUP BY phone
                    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
                </code>
            </pre>
        </section>

        <section id="task3">
            <h2>3. Post-Migration QA & Debugging</h2>
            <p>Post-migration QA involves comparing datasets using <b>pandas</b>, checking detailed order histories, product listings, and customer data. Inventory sync issues are traced via SKU-level comparisons. Correcting prices quickly is done using <b>Shopify's bulk CSV import</b> or manual bulk edits.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="task4">
            <h2>4. High-Volume Optimization</h2>
            <p>To optimize high-volume data uploads, we use batching and parallel requests within API limits. The <b>Shopify Bulk Operations API</b> is leveraged for scalability, and parallel requests are used sparingly for data unsupported by Bulk. Detailed logging and automatic retry mechanisms are implemented for robustness.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="task5">
            <h2>5. Live Issue Response & Communication</h2>
            <p>The immediate response to live issues, such as incorrect prices, involves rapid assessment and a potential temporary store lockdown. Communication to stakeholders is done via <b>Slack</b>. A rapid fix strategy is implemented, including a bulk <b>CSV</b> upload for immediate price corrections. An example message is:  "Hey team â€“ we've identified incorrect prices on the live store. I'm actively correcting this and expect resolution within 30 mins. Updates to follow."</p>
        </section>

        <section id="task6">
            <h2>6. Your Migration</h2>
            <p>In a previous project, I managed a data migration involving clinical trial data from multiple online sources. The problem was consolidating inconsistent and incomplete datasets. We used <b>Python</b> for web scraping, <b>pandas</b> for data cleaning, and regular expressions for normalization. The approach involved custom scripts for data extraction, cleaning, and validation. The outcome was a unified, high-quality dataset for accurate analysis.</p>
